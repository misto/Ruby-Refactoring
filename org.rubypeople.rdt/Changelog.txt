Changes since 0.6.0:
* Multiple debugger session possible because a free port will be used for the debugger communication. The port is written to a
  temporary file and conveyed to the ruby process with "-r<tmpFile>". The fixed port used in the past (1098) is still the default 
  port in the case that a temporary file can not be created
* Catchpoints:
	* The default was to halt at every type of StandardError, the new default is *not* to halt when exceptions are raised
	* There is a menu entry in the debug perspective and a toolbar button in the breakpoint view which starts the Catchpoint dialog
	* The catchpoint dialog allows to add a ruby exception breakpoint
	* There can be at most one exception breakpoint; the breakpoint can be enabled, disabled and removed in the breakpoint view
* Added outline support for aliasing methods using the format 'alias :new_method :old_method'
* Fixed bug where current visibility was never reset when opening a new class
* Ruby Search

Changes merged from SRB 0.6.1:
* SRB_0-6-1_1: Enable/Disable breakpoints, move breakpoints 
* SRB_0-6-1_2: Highlighting: added here docs, fixed ?#, fixed =begin =end with keywords not starting on first column
* SRB_0-6-1_3: Fixed Test::Unit problems with finding a free port
               Fixed interpreter error for Test::Unit configuration created from the run configuration dialog with new 
               (instead of Run As->Test::Unit which uses the Shortcut)

Release 0.6.0:
* Code folding:
    * Ability to enable/disable
    * Preference page allows you to choose to auto-collapse
        * Inner types
        * Methods
        * RDoc (not really working yet)
* Much more intelligent parsing
    *  Annotations and highlights of syntax errors
    *  Annotations and highlights of warnings created by JRuby parser
* Auto-complete of brackets, parens, and single/double quotes
* Task tag recognition
    * Ability to set multiple tags
    * Ability to set low, normal or high priorities for tags
    * Early versions from Head (no official releases) would install a TODO marker that
      would not be removed. This bug was fixed, but if you've got "stuck Tasks" that 
      don't match actual task tags in your source file, there are two ways to remove them.
      1) open the file in the text editor (right-click on the file in Resource Navigator, and 
      select Open With - Text Editor).  You can then right click on the task tag in the left margin
      and select Remove Task
      2) If this doesn't work, you need to basically delete the file, and create a new one in its place.
* Added shortcuts for inspection during debug session:
    * Extension to the editor's pop-up menu
    * Preference page
* Added RI view
* Fixed bug in Debugger which crashed Eclipse (no more handles)
* Fixed bug [1078036]: Cursor moves to document start when formatting whole document (i.e. there is no selection)
* Fixed bug [1090687]: Uncomment broken
* Fixed bug [1079795]: Warning in variable view
* Saving an editor in debug session triggers code reload of ruby interpreter
* Tab jumps to correct position
* Fixed bug [1098315]: Incorrect formatting if semicolon are used directly attached to keywords, i.e. no separating spaces
* Test::Unit tests can be launched in debug mode
* Syntax highlighting (and customization) of regular expressions and commands
* Committed patch by Khaled Agrama so Eclipse 3.1 would recognize .rb files with Ruby Editor
* Committed patch for bug 959808. Singleton methods are now recognized correctly in the outlinew view
* Create commands for launch short cuts so keys could be bound to them.  Configured default key bindings.
* Changed default key bindings for Comment, Uncomment and ToggleComment to be consistent with JDT.  Changed the keybinding
  category to "Ruby Source" so it doesn't clash with JDT.
* Fixed source positioning bug for outline view.
* Updated RI view w/ patch from Khaled Agrama (Aug. 7, 2005) which allows user to start typing, and matches to show as the user types
* Updated jruby.jar (to 1.9). Includes fix for random Syntax Error issues dealing with quotes. 
* Updated jruby.jar (1.9). Disables the "useless use of literal ... in void context" warning.
* Widen scope of what is considered a "ruby file" for the Ruby resources view - recognize .yml, Rakefile and any file starting with '#!' and 'ruby' in the first line
* Added "Generate Rdoc" action which will generate RI compatible rdoc for a project and auto-update the RI view
