RubyInformation.interpreter_not_selected= You must define an interpreter before viewing Ruby information.
RubyInformation.ri_not_found= Ri is either not installed or not found. Please set the path to ri through Window > Preferences > Ruby > Ri / Rdoc. This view reflects changes of the path automatically. The ri path should point a file called ri in your ruby installation directory. If there is no such file, you probably can create one if you have rdoc installed (this is tested with version 1.0.1). The file needs to import (require) 'rdoc/ri/ri_driver' and then the line RiDriver.new.process_args.
RubyInformation.tool_tip= Ask Ri for help
RubyInformation.run= Run RI
RubyInformation.please_wait= Please wait...
