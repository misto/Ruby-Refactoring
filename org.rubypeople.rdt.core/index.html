<h1>Ruby Eclipse</h1>
<h2>The essentials</h2>
<p>RubyEclipse, or RDT as I like to call it when talking to other Eclipse
users, is a plugin for the Eclipse framework that is being developed at
www.eclipse.org. Eclipse is written in Java, but that in no way prevents it
from being a useful application (although everyone I know who uses Ruby
thinks it should be rewritten in that language). That aside, there is no
usefulness in rewriting resource manipulation tools (cut, paste, code
management...). In order to make Eclipse able to understand Ruby artifacts,
it must be 'taught', as they like to say at IBM when they outline the
framework. That is what I want to accomplish. Some of my co-workers are
actually being paid to develop a testing framework in Ruby. They are
accustomed to working in an object-based environment (as opposed to file
based), and so am I. It is very important to us as developers to remove the
pain of dealing with the environment: allow us to think about the problems
we are trying to solve and model them in an object-oriented way.
</p>
<h3>Obtaining and installing Eclipse</h3>
<p>RDT is a plugin. In order to use it, you must first acquire the
Eclipse platform. Currently, RDT requires Eclipse 2.0.
<a href='http://www.eclipse.org/downloads'>Download here.</a> Unzip Eclipse.
Extract RDT into the eclipse/plugins directory. Start Eclipse.
</p>
<h2>Creating a Ruby Project</h2>
<p>When you look at the workbench, it is not obvious to the newcomer that the
platform is indeed aware of Ruby or any other specific resource. Click on the
New Resource Wizard button. This is
the little guy located on the top left of the Resource Perspective (and
every other Perspective). You should see an entry for Ruby. Choose Ruby
Project and click next. Enter the name of your project. Projects are simply
a way to manage resources. They provide a sort of namespace, as well. You
will see more of this as we go forward, but those of you familiar with
Eclipse and developing Java in it see this with build paths configuration.</p>
<h2>Create folders and files</h2>
<p>Click on the New Resource Wizard button. You
can now choose Simple > Folder or Simple > File. The folders can contain .rb
files any level deep. When you create a .rb file, Eclipse will open a Ruby
editor. Note that the editor has a long way to go to be considered perfect,
but with Eclipse as the framework, it won't take as long as it could.
Eclipse provides outliner (an object view of the code), code completion and
other API tools to make developing the editor a much simpler matter. More to
come!!</p>
<h2>Make your files 'require folder1/folder2/someFile'</h2>
<p>You can reference
modules in your code, even when they exist in other projects. You must right
click on the project and choose Properties > Ruby Project Properties. In
here you can check other Ruby projects that you would like to include in
your build path.</p>
<h2>Choose a file or a project and click on the Running Man button</h2>
<p>If you don't see the running man, you must choose Window > Customize Perspective.
Expand the Other branch and enable the Launch check box. This will add the Debug
and Run buttons. This will allow you to create a Launch Configuration where you can
specify exactly which file to launch, interpreter and program arguments, and
which interpreter to run with. If you have yet to define an interpreter,
click New. You can also define interpreters in Window > Preferences > Ruby.
Click on Run. You should see the debugger come up (unless you specify in
Preferences that it should not Window > Preferences > Debug > Uncheck 'Show
Debug Perspective when a program is launched in run mode'. Your I/O will be
hooked up to another view called 'Console'.</p>
<h2>I have not done anything with Ruby GUI stuff. I would be curious to know
if anyone gets something running, recommendations, etc.</h2>
<p>Please, help me to know what needs to be done. I need a 'customer', and
would like for the Ruby developer community to be it. Thanks for trying it
out, all of you who have. If you want to keep up on what is going on, and
would like to ask more questions, please sign up and move the discussions
over <a href='https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/rubyeclipse-development'>here</a>
