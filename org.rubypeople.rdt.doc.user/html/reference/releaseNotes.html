	files for editing. The Resources view also traverses directories correctly now.

	context menu.

* Fixed Windows space in path issue
* Editor now has soft keywords/colors, but you can't change them yet
* Improved syntax highlighting
* Interpreters now only need to know directory of ruby/rubyw. No .exe is required.
* Project wizard now shows under new project
* When only one interpreter is installed, it is the selected one
* The default working directory is now the workspace folder
* New project wizard no longer ignores custom project loctation
* There is now a Ruby Application Shortcut launcher


There are other things that have been improved that won't be obvious. There is one thing
that you will need to do to make this thing work on existing Ruby Projects. You MUST CHANGE
THE NATURE ID IN YOUR .project FILES FOR RUBY PROJECTS. It needs to be org.rubypeople.rdt.core.rubynature.
You will then need to either close and reopen each project that you changed or restart the
workbench.
