Automatic build and test step by step guide

1) CVS
The automatic build uses an external CVS command (not the eclipse built-in CVS). Therefore
you have to install CVS. The following CVS command must run from the command line:

cvs -d :ext:anything:/cvsroot/rubyeclipse export -r HEAD org.rubypeople.rdt/ruby.png

As you can see, username and host are not part of the CVSROOT. That allows to use the same
map file for different users. The host and username can be hardcoded in your CVS_RSH command.
E.g. using plink (command line part of putty) on windows, you can create a batch file like the
following and set CVS_RSH to this batch file:

@echo off
set CMD_LINE_ARGS=
:setArgs
if ""%1""=="""" goto doneSetArgs
set CMD_LINE_ARGS=%CMD_LINE_ARGS% %1
shift
goto setArgs
:doneSetArgs
echo %CMD_LINE_ARGS% > D:/Temp/tests
D:\bin\plink -load cvs-ssh -pw <myPW> 

2) Get the bootstrap files

cvs -d :ext:anything:/cvsroot/rubyeclipse export -r HEAD org.rubypeople.rdt.build/bootstrap

After a successful retrieval you will find the following files:

README: This file
run.bat: run script for windows
run.sh: run script for linux
customTargets.xml: build file which is being called during the build process
build.properties: property entries for the build process


3) Java VM 
You have probably java 1.4 installed. Set the vm variable in the run script.

4) Eclipse build host
If you have eclipse already installed on the computer where you intent to run the automatic
build, you can use this installation as build host. Otherwise get an eclipse platform zip
file and extract it. Set the eclipseDir variable in the run script appropriately.
