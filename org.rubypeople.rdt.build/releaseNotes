0.9.0
-----------------------------------------
* Limited debugging capabilities. Tons of thanks to Markus Barchfeld for this! We look forward to this
	growing over time, and plan to focus on it.
* Configurable syntax highlighting (color, weight).
* Ruby Perspective improvments, particularly the Ruby Resources view has a context menu and you can open
	files for editing. The Resources view also traverses directories correctly now.
* Commenting/Uncommenting of lines using Ctrl+/, Ctrl+\. You can see these in the Ruby menu group that
	appears when a ruby editor is open or the ruby perspective is active. It is also in the ruby editor
	context menu.
* All Ruby keywords are highlighted.
* Code completion works for keywords.
* Ruby Application Shortcut for debug.
* Limited ruby file outlining. This includes synchronizing the selection in the outline with the editor.
* Fixed keyword highlighting not to highlight keywords that have text immediately adjacent.

There are other things that have been improved that won't be obvious. There is one thing
that you will need to do to make this thing work on existing Ruby Projects. You MUST CHANGE
THE NATURE ID IN YOUR .project FILES FOR RUBY PROJECTS. It needs to be org.rubypeople.rdt.core.rubynature.
You will then need to either close and reopen each project that you changed or restart the
workbench.
