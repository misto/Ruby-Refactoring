There are other things that have been improved that won't be obvious. There is one thing
that you will need to do to make this thing work on existing Ruby Projects. You MUST CHANGE
THE NATURE ID IN YOUR .project FILES FOR RUBY PROJECTS. It needs to be org.rubypeople.rdt.core.rubynature.
You will then need to either close and reopen each project that you changed or restart the
workbench.
