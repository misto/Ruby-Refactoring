1.	Requirements

	Please note that RDT is an Eclipse plugin. This means that your system must meet the requirements
	of Eclipse <www.eclipse.org>.
	
	We have decided to maintain RDT as a plugin for Eclipse 2.0.x. This just means that we code against
	that API. The Eclipse 2.1 release notes claim that code written for 2.0 will run on 2.1 versions.
	
	A ruby interpreter. We have only tested with ruby 1.6.7.
	
2.	Installation

	Download and install Eclipse 2.0.x. Extract the contents of rubyeclipse_x.x.x.zip into the plugins
	directory of your Eclipse installation. You must restart Eclipse to load the RDT plugins.
	
	Copy the files debug.rb and eclipseDebug.rb to your <ruby install>\lib\ruby\1.6.x directory. This
	allows RDT to connect to a running ruby process for debugging. It will not prevent you from debugging
	with the ruby command line. If you have customized your debug.rb, you'll have to merge our debug.rb
	with yours.
