******************
* General UI issues
******************
- Fix the debugging current line highlighting.
- Provide a model of a ruby file for the outline view.
- Refresh the ruby file outline when the file is saved.
- Allow customization of keywords
- Honor eclipse single-click prefs
- Add outline view to ruby perspective

******************
* Website
******************
- Get rid of the wiki that is there.
- Ask Matt to create a logo. I'm thinking of a ruby gem that is eclipsing the sun. Have a couple of lines that
	represent light dispersion, something like the Eclipse logo, except they should have a rose color.
- Decide on a general laf.
- Come up with a content outline.

******************
* Debugger
******************
- Update variables view:
  - remove pointless icons from view toolbar, like "show final fields"
  - add icon to view toolbar for showing global variables
- Allow evaluation of ruby expressions in the display view  
- Why are breakpoints not hit when executing runit tests ?
- Make breakpoints persistent
- Refresh thread list in debug view regularly (now it is only refreshed, whenever a
  suspension (breakpoint, exception, next) occurs)
- Allow debugging of several ruby programs concurrently (there is a socket bind exception now)
- Introduce exception breakpoints (see TC_DebuggerCommunicationTest::testNameError)
